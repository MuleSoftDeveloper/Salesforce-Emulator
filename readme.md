# Salesforce Emulator
This project emulates request and response flows of some of the Salesforce partner SOAP API. Used for Developer onboarding so they don't need to sign up for a trial account and lose their path.

Currently all responses are emulated with predefined payloads. Future iterations can potentially use the Salesforce account.

Cannot use WSDL to generate SOAP service since the payload deviates from pure SOAP standard.

## Requirements
Anypoint Studio 6.4
Mule runtime 3.9.1
